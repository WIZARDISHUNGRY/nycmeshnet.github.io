The simple way to use search is to just enter the node number you are looking for, and all the other nodes will be hidden.

There's also few key words in the search- active, potential, supernode, hub, panorama ("pano" for short), nopano and roof. You can use these in combination- "active hub" etc. There's also ">" and "<" for searching for node numbers. To search for more recent nodes you could search "> 1000" or search for old potential nodes with panoramas- "< 500 potential pano". Search also searches the details about the node that are visible in the infobox. The layers "link", "kiosk", "active" and "potential" can be hidden by prepending a "-", e.g. "-kiosk". The search can also be accessed via the URL e.g. [https://nycmesh.net/map/?s=227](https://nycmesh.net/map/?s=227)
