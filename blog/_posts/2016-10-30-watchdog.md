title: "Watchdogs"

Wireless networks have a bit a reputation for instability. I think modern hardware has fixed hardware problems, but there is a bit of work that needs to be done to make the firmware reliable. You can do this with "watchdog" scripts.

Our firmware image comes with a "bmx6health"" script that checks whether the mesh software is running correctly and restarts it if necessary. This script by default runs once per day. I've found it better to run this every 5 minutes. You can do this by editing the crontab-

ssh into the router and in the terminal-

```
crontab -e
```

This opens a [vi editor] and you can change or add different scripts to run at different times. (The vi commands you need are "i" to insert, "esc" to stop editing, and ":x" to save and eXit.)

And change the start of bmx6health line to `*/5`:

```
*/5 * * * * /etc/qmp/bmx6health.sh >> /tmp/log/bmx6health.log
```

`*/5 * * * *` means once every 5 minutes.

For some nodes, their main purpose is to be an internet gateway. To ensure that they always try to be online, you can add a watchdog script that pings a known website and calls "network restart" if it fails. These kind of scripts often ping 8.8.8.8, which is Google's DNS server.

The script I ended up using was one this one by Michael Stapelberg- [openwrt_wan_watchdog](http://michael.stapelberg.de/Artikel/openwrt_wan_watchdog)

in the terminal-

```
vi /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```

and paste this:

```
#!/bin/sh

tries=0
while [[ $tries -lt 5 ]]
do
	if /bin/ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 >/dev/null
	then
		exit 0
	fi
	tries=$((tries+1))
done

/etc/init.d/network restart
```

Make it executable- 

```
chmod +x /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```

Afterwards, add the following entry with crontab -e

```
*/7 * * * * /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```
