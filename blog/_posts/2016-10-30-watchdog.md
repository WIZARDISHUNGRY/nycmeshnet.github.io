title: "Watchdogs"

Wireless networks have a bit of a reputation for instability. Modern hardware has fixed most hardware problems, but there is a bit of work that needs to be done to make the firmware reliable. You can do this with "watchdog" scripts.

Our firmware image comes with a "bmx6health" script that checks whether the mesh software is running correctly and restarts it if necessary. This script by default runs once per day. I've found it better to run this every 5 minutes. You can do this by editing the crontab-

ssh into the router and in the terminal-

```
crontab -e
```

This opens a [vi editor](http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html) and you can change or add different scripts to run at different times. (The vi commands you need are "i" to insert, "esc" to stop editing, and ":x" to save and eXit.)

And change the start of bmx6health line to `*/5`:

```
*/5 * * * * /etc/qmp/bmx6health.sh >> /tmp/log/bmx6health.log
```

`*/5 * * * *` means once every 5 minutes.

For some nodes, their main purpose is to be an internet gateway. To ensure that they always try to be online, you can add a watchdog script that pings a known website and calls "network restart" if it fails. These kind of scripts often ping 8.8.8.8, which is Google's DNS server.

The script I ended up using was one this one by Michael Stapelberg- [openwrt_wan_watchdog](http://michael.stapelberg.de/Artikel/openwrt_wan_watchdog)

in the terminal-

```
vi /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```

and paste this:

```
#!/bin/sh

tries=0
while [[ $tries -lt 5 ]]
do
	if /bin/ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 >/dev/null
	then
		exit 0
	fi
	tries=$((tries+1))
done

/etc/init.d/network restart
```

Make it executable- 

```
chmod +x /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```

Afterwards, add the following entry with crontab -e

```
*/7 * * * * /root/wan-watchdog.sh
```

In the original script the cron job is every minute. I made this every 7 minutes as I think you could get a cascade of restarts if you have every node checking every minute. Also it could disrupt mesh-only traffic if the check was too often.

Another problem I've had occasionally is that the wifi will lose connections. Even though the radio is on and it seems normal, it won't connect. I've written a simple script to restart the wlan0 ad-hoc interface. It is a bit of a hack since the interface may be ok, just nothing is connected, but since nothing is connected it doesn't hurt to reset it.

Here's the wlan0-watchdog.sh script. Add it like the other scripts above. It also writes a log of the last time it reset. By default wlan0 is the ad-hoc interface that is used to mesh the routers.

```
AHSIGNAL=`iwinfo wlan0 info | grep 'Signal: unknown' | wc -l`
if [ $AHSIGNAL = "0" ]; then
   # there are connections to wlan0
   echo "wlan0 ad-hoc working"
else
   # no connections to wlan0, so reset interface in case it is down
  echo "[$(date)] no connections, resetting wlan0" > /tmp/log/ah-watchdog.log
  ifconfig wlan0 down
  ifconfig wlan0 up
  echo "reset wlan0 ad-hoc"
fi
```
