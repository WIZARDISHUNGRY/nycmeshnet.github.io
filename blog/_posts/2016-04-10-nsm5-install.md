NanoStation NSM5 installs 



**Hardware**

The simplest install is to use an existing vertical pipe and the two plastic ties that are included with the router. Also a thick PVC pipe can be attached to a railing using clamps.

If you need to aim the router up or down you can use a [nanobracket](https://www.streakwave.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=NBU001).

The [Ubiquiti window/wall mount](http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-NanoStation-Window-Mount/dp/B004EHUR8U) is a versatile mount that comes with a suction cup for windows or a screw mount for walls. The parts are reversible so the NSM5 can face either way and it also has vertical and horizontal adjustment to point in almost any direction.

The [Ubiquiti universal antenna mount](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J1WSGI/) can be used on rooftops or walls, where a very strong mount is needed.

**Window**

Outside:  
On the outside of the window it is best to use a Ubiquiti wall/window mount.

Inside:  
It is often more convenient to install inside the window. You will lose about 2db of signal but that is usually ok.

Velcro is the easiest way to install a NanoStation if it will be facing the same direction as the window.

A Ubiquiti suction cup mount can be used if you need to point the router at an angle.

**Rooftop**

Often rooftops have an existing unused pipe or abandoned antenna pole that can be used.

A Ubiquiti bracket is good if you have a drillable surface such as brick or cement.

**Wall**

A simple wall mount can be made using a small, thin piece of wood and the two plastic ties that come with the router. This will not give you much choice in direction.

The Ubiquiti window/wall mount comes with both a suction cup for windows and a screw mount for walls. Use this screw mount on a wall so you can point the router in the best direction.

**Tree**

Sometimes a tree is the best place for your NanoStation.

If you need to install two NanoStations you can simple run a cable from the spare ethernet port to the other NSM5. This is called POE passthrough. It is sometimes on by default. If not here are the (cryptic) commands-

to switch POE passthrough on:

`echo 8 1 1 > /proc/gpio/system_led`

to switch POE passthrough off:

`echo 8 1 0 > /proc/gpio/system_led`

On the NSM5 the "main" port is LAN and the secondary is "WAN". This is the most confusing thing about the router and mixing this up is the cause of most problems. Always connect WAN on one router to LAN on another!
