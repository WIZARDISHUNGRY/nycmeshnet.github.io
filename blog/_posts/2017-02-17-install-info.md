We have a few different types of install. At the moment we are mostly doing installs in downtown Manhattan that connect directly to the supernode- a "supernode client install"

**1) Supernode client**

You need to be within about two miles of the Wall St. area. We can usually tell by a panorama pic whether this install will work for you.

***Equipment needed***-

LiteBeamAC available from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-5GHz-LiteBeam-23DBI-LBE-5AC-23-US/dp/B01ANIQCE6/) or [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1195609-REG) for about $70

Ethernet cable and antenna mast (supplied by install team) ~$20

Indoor router - ask us about this

Please look after the install team. We do not pay them and they might appreciate a tip or some food etc.

You may also optionally do a monthly [donation](../donate)

**Other install types-**

**2) Building to building**

This is usually a NanoStation M5 connected to a nearby established neighborhood network

**3) Point to point**

Email us directly for details on a point to point connection. This can be as fast as a gigabit, but requires dedicated hardware. We can also wire the entire building with ethernet to provide all residents with a connection.
