We have a few different types of install. At the moment we are mostly doing installs in downtown Manhattan that connect directly to the supernode- a "supernode client install"

**1) Supernode client**

You need to be within about two miles of the Wall St. area. We can usually tell by a panorama pic whether this install will work for you.

***Equipment needed***-

We supply the LiteBeamAC, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](https://nycmesh.net/donate/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.


**2) Kiosk client install**

This is similar to supernode client but uses a NanoStation aimed at a LinkNYC kiosk on the avenue below.

We supply the NanoStation NSM5, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router.

The total for the equipment is [$110](https://nycmesh.net/donate/), and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer).

$160 per apartment is due on the day of the install. We also suggest a monthly subscription of $20 to help us maintain our network.

If you want to try this yourself read this [blog post](../public-access-points).

**3) Building to building**

This is usually a NanoStation M5 connected to a nearby established neighborhood network

**4) Point to point**

Email us directly for details on a point to point connection. This can be as fast as a gigabit, but requires dedicated hardware. We can also wire the entire building with ethernet to provide all residents with a connection. Hardware can be as little as $130 for two LiteBeams or $3000 for a pair of gigabit AirFiber.
