We have a few different types of install. At the moment we are mostly doing installs in downtown Manhattan that connect directly to the supernode- a "supernode client install"

**1) Supernode client**

You need to be within about two miles of the Wall St. area. We can usually tell by a panorama pic whether this install will work for you.

***Equipment needed***-

We supply the LiteBeam, antenna mount (if needed), ethernet, ethernet switch (if needed) and indoor router for 

The equipment is $110, and the install is $50 (paid to an independent installer)

The total is $160/per apartment due on the day of the install, or you can ask about a monthly subscription.

**Other install types-**

**2) Building to building**

This is usually a NanoStation M5 connected to a nearby established neighborhood network

**3) Point to point**

Email us directly for details on a point to point connection. This can be as fast as a gigabit, but requires dedicated hardware. We can also wire the entire building with ethernet to provide all residents with a connection.
