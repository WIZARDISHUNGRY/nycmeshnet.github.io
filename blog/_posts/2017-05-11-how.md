How to start a community network in your location. Here are some rough notes that I will be gradually expanding.

---

**Research**

It is important to do some research first. There are a few really big community networks (mostly non-English speaking). The biggest is [Guifi](https://guifi.net/en/node/38392) in Spain. Others include [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/en/) in Germany, and [Wlan Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/en/). Guifi began on farms and gradually expanded across the country. They use hundreds of kilometers of fiber, and wifi in all modes- point-to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and mesh (MP2MP).

**Essential Reading**

[Wireless Networking in the Developing World (WNDW)](http://wndw.net/book.html) is a great free book about designing, implementing, and maintaining low-cost wireless networks. http://wndw.net/book.html. 

You need to know the basics of wifi and networking. The OSI layers, IPv4, IPv6, 2.4GHz vs 5GHz wifi, wifi modes- infrastructure vs. ad-hoc (which is used by mesh routers) etc. This book covers all of that.

[Governing the Commons, Ostrum](https://www.amazon.com/Governing-Commons-Evolution-Institutions-Collective/dp/B00DELQ2T0/ref=sr_1_3?)  Design principles illustrated by long-enduring "common pool resources" (CPR) institutions-

*  Clearly defined boundaries
*  Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions
*  Collective-choice arrangements
*  Monitoring
*  Graduated sanctions
*  Conflict-resolution mechanisms
*  Minimal recognition of rights to organize

**Install your first node**

Some groups never get around to installing anything. Just go and install your first node to prove you can. Set up a public access point in a cafe or other meeting place. With each successful install you get experience, publicity and more members joining.

**Online collaboration**

* Chat software (Slack)

* Meeting (Meetup)

* Planning (Trello)

* Build your website with a map, join form, blog and your [commons license](https://nycmesh.net/ncl.pdf)

* Tweet and get local news involved. Local news gets stories from the hashtags for their area. 
**Whole buildings**

Try to get whole buildings to install a roof antenna and run ethernet to the apartments. You want long term installs! Don't connect rooftops unless a) multiple tenants OR b) person owns apartment OR c) person intends to stay very long time i.e. avoid students etc who may move out! 

**Gateways**

Plan your internet gateways. An IXP or ISP may donate a connection as DE-CIX and Packet.net did for us. Another kind of gateway is a public wifi access point. By using directional routers you can extend the range of public access points very easily. Here are some instructions- [how to connect to a kiosk.](../public-access-points). This uses a NanoStation.

**Tall structures**

Tall structures are the fastest way to expand the wireless mesh. There are a few different types in a city and you need to try them all- housing association buildings, skyscrapers, [churches](../../leaflet/church.pdf), schools, libraries, existing antenna masts and building coops. Make specific presentations and handouts for different types of structures.

**Supernodes**

Plan your first major gigabit install at an IXP or tower. This will have sector antennas (P2MP) and point to point. You may need a network engineer to help in their spare time. An IXP connection requires a network engineer familiar with BGP.

**Computer networking groups**

Go to local NANOG and other computer networking groups

Talk to local WISPs and alternate ISPs. WISPs have all the skills needed to make a fast wifi network.

**Fiscal sponsor**

Get a non-profit to be your fiscal sponsor (ISOC in your state etc.). This will make it easier to accept donations and get grants.

**Grants**

Apply for grants!

**Collaborations**

Look for potential collaborations
