If you need to limit how much bandwidth people are using on your router, you can use Wondershaper. Wondershaper is already part of our latest firmware. You just need to go to this URL-

https://admin.qmp/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/wshaper

or 

https://10.x.x.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/wshaper (replace the "x"'s with your router's URL)

Enter your name/pass (email us if you don't have it)

You should then see the Wondershaper interface. Just click "Save & Apply" to use the defaults. Otherwise change the values as required. The default values are very low, so maybe increase the numbers.
